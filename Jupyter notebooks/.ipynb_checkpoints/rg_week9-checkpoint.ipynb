    "# Week 9 Jupyter Notebook Assignment - Conceptualization\n",
    "## Reviewing NLTK and introduction to Part of Speech Tagging\n",
    "\n",
    "### This week's assignment is based on content originally developed for the Digital Humanities Research Institute <br> June 13, 2018 and previous work by former GC Digital Fellows, Michelle A. McSweeney, Ph.D. and Rachel Rakov, Ph.D. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we continue our discussion of conceptualization--connecting research questions and our data with what can be measured and counted--we will focus a bit on feature selection and tagging. In the authorship attribution exercises that we worked through, you can see how unique textual \"signatures\" that recur within an author's work are used to predict the likelihood that another document may also be authored by the person with the \"textual signatures\" most similar to the features in the anonymous document. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this week's notebook, we're going to review steps that we have performed several times now in previous assignments. At the end, we will use a new process, called Part of Speech tagging. We will draw on the POS tagger that comes with NLTK, and we will create a list of paired sets, called 'tuples'. In each 'tuple', there will be a tokenized word and a part of speech. If you are interested in learning more about *how* the part of speech tagger works, you can read up on it in [Chapter 5 of Natural Language Processing with Python](https://www.nltk.org/book_1ed/ch05.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "As we learned from previous reading, part of speech is an often used tag that can be used to discover salient features, which can then be used to classify texts. When we have existing \"tags\" or metadata or descriptive information about our data, we can perform \"supervised\" machine learning processes. Unsupervised machine learning is when we use an algorithm to detect features, and then to use those features to create predictions. Be sure to read the Meredith Broussard chapter on \"supervised\" and \"unsupervised\" artificial intelligence. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you need help understanding the notebook, you can follow along with all of the cells until the Catching Fire activity by going to the [DHRI Curriculum, Text Analysis Workshop](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/text-analysis) and following along. This notebook follows that workshop very closely. "

The concordance bewlo will show the first 25 instances of the word \"whale\" in _Moby Dick_. It will also show the words that appear directly before and directly after the word \"whale.\" We have done this activity in previous notebooks. By going into the existing NLTK text corpora, select a text and a term. Generate a new concordance for a new term. What can we learn by the ten words that directly preceed and directly follow another word? Are there analytical questions that we can ask using this view?  "
