    "* To become more familiar with various pipelines for cleaning and preparing data for text analysis; \n",
    "* To consider the challenges that the availability and scarcity of data presents to the literary scholar (and to consider how other kinds of research might also need to address similar issues); \n",

    "## Importing Data\n",
    "You've worked with data during the Datacamp exercises, but that was a much more controlled environment. When you are actually doing your own text analysis project, you will have a much messier process. During this week's reading, you will have read several pieces about what cleaning takes place and some of the challenges that data presents when working with text. In particular, we're looking at text analysis from a humanities / litereary perspective; however, one might argue that these challenges are more similar to the text analysis one might perform in the social sciences or with non-fiction work than might appear to be the case on the surface. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll practice importing data: \n",
    "* from a file already on your computer (using a directory path); \n",
    "* from a file on the web using a URL request \n",
    "* from a file on the web using Beautiful Soup. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many other ways to collect data, and perhaps some of our time could / should be spent on webscraping in order to collect data. The easiest way to get lots of data is by importing with an API. For those who are looking for a challenge, try importing Movie Reviews from the New York Times via their API for your notebook assignment this week instead. Be sure to use BeautifulSoup to prettify it, and then store the data in a pandas dataframe. "

First, we import the URLLIB package, and specifically the `request` module. We assign the URL we want to manipulate by assigning the URL to a variable. Next, we pass the URL through the urlopen.request function from the URLLIB package, and also at the same time \"read\" the file. The output of that string becomes the variable `html`. When we print the variable html, we discover that all of the HTML from the page has been pulled into the variable name. Unfortuantely, it doesn't look very clean. "

    "In this exercise, you queried an API from Chronicling America and pulled in files that included the search term \"poetry.\" Those files, then, were cleaned and made slightly more tidy by highlighting the \"keys\" to the dictionary, and then taking one small section of the dictionary and turning it into a dataframe. In a markdown section, look over what you have done, and try changing the search *parameter* at the top of the exercise. What changes when you re run the activity? What is \"messy\" about the file that makes it hard to work with? What is \"clean\" about the file that makes it easier to work with? "
